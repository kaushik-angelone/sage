// altimate_change start — TUI worker console guard (systemic fix for recurring log regressions)
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS / WHY LOG REGRESSIONS KEEP COMING BACK ON EVERY UPSTREAM MERGE:
// The interactive TUI runs the server in a Bun Worker *thread* (cli/tui/worker.ts ->
// Server.Default().fetch). A worker thread shares the process's stdout/stderr file
// descriptors with the main thread, which is where the TUI draws. RPC between the two
// is over postMessage (util/rpc.ts), NOT stdout — so the worker's stdout/stderr carry
// nothing functional, yet ANY in-process write to them corrupts the render:
//   - snowflake-sdk's Winston console transport,
//   - upstream Effect `Logging`,
//   - our own Log shim when --print-logs is on,
//   - and, critically, any dependency or code path a FUTURE upstream merge introduces.
//
// Historically each offender was suppressed one-by-one inside upstream-owned files, so
// every bridge merge that re-extracted those files silently dropped the hook and the TUI
// flooded again. This guard fixes the whole CLASS at the single chokepoint: it redirects
// THIS worker's stdout/stderr to the persistent log file once, before any other module
// runs. New offenders are handled automatically; there is nothing per-offender for a
// merge to drop — only this one guard, which a presence test asserts stays wired
// (test/upstream/fork-feature-guards.test.ts) and an output-hygiene smoke test backstops
// (test/cli/smokes/output-hygiene.test.ts).
//
// Must be imported FIRST in worker.ts so the redirect is installed before anything logs.
